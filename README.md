## Directory Structure

*   Each practical is housed in its own directory named `C_Practical_<number>`.
*   Inside each directory, there is a C source file named `<number>.c` and its corresponding compiled executable `<number>.exe`.

## Contents

The practicals cover a wide range of C programming concepts, progressing from basic input/output to advanced topics like pointers, structures, and file handling.

Check `Concepts.txt` for a detailed breakdown of the programming concepts utilized in each specific practical.

## How to Run

Navigate to the directory of the practical you wish to run and execute the compiled binary. For example, to run practical 5:

```bash
cd C_Practical_5
./5.exe
```
